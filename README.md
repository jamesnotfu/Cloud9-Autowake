# c9-autowake
Cloud9 hosted URLs go to sleep every couple hours. With a C9 hosted website, this may result in pages displaying blank content. This code wakes up the C9 server before loading the page.

# EDIT 1/27/18
Sorry, but this is no longer a solution to cloud9 hosted websites as AWS is now integrated with Cloud9. No additional commits will be made to this project.
